          <p>Dear Sponsors and Exhibitors,</p>
          <p>For 11 years, VAYA has organized the Tết Festival, the largest Vietnamese
            New Year event in San Diego and the second largest event of its kind
            in Southern California. The Festival is one of the most anticipated annual
            events for the Vietnamese community in San Diego. Highlights of the festival
            include the Lion Dances, Miss Vietnam San Diego Pageant, Golden Voice
            singing competition, the Cultural Village and various other performances.</p>
          <p>This is a great opportunity for your business or organization to establish
            an on-going presence in the Vietnamese community, introduce new products
            or services and to tie non-profit investment strategy to your business
            development plan. On average, our festival attracts more than 25,000
            people each year.</p>
