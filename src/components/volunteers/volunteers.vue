			<p>We are looking for friendly, helpful, reliable volunteers to help with this exciting festival. Our festival will be filled with people of all ages. If you were at the festival last year, then you have a general idea of how big the festival will be this year and how much fun everyone will have. If you didn't attend the festival last year, then here is an opportunity for you to come to the festival and help make this upcoming festival even bigger and better!</p>
